# Technologies

The backend of Fauxflix is implemented using the Ruby on Rails framework with a PostGreSQL database, while the frontend is managed using the React and Redux libraries of Javascript to manage state and pass important information to child components. The app also uses the FontAwesome and Swiper libraries for icons and the genre carousel. It is styled with SCSS while the thumbnails and videos are hosted on Amazon AWS.
